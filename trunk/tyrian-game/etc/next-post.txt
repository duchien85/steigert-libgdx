#10 - libgdx Tutorial: Keyboard and Accelerometer

Important changes
 - Updated the <b>ADT Plugin</b> on Eclipse to version 17. It seems that every JAR that's inside the "libs" folder
   of an Android project is added automatically to its classpath. I also noticed that the <b>tyrian-game</b> was not
   being sent to the Android device, so the game crashed because of a <b>ClassNotFoundException<b>. This is what I did to
   fix the problems:
     1 Removed all the JARs from the classpath manually and let Android reference them through the new
       "Android Dependencies" classpath item.
     2 Copied the "gdx.jar" from <b>tyrian-game/libs</b> to <b>tyrian-android/libs</b>.
     3 Exported the <b>tyrian-game</b> item in <b>Properties > Java Build Path > Order and Export</b> of <b>tyrian-android</b>.
